00:00
hey guys welcome back to another video
00:03
you're about to watch the finale of the
00:06
agent matter cake defy christmas arena
00:09
this is a tournament that crashed leech
00:11
us on december 21st it attracted so many
00:14
of the top players in the world
00:15
including magnus hikaru
00:18
and karjakin who i unknowingly played
00:20
and maybe beat stay tuned for that one
00:23
as usual i'm gonna time stamp every
00:25
single game in the video description so
00:27
feel free to hop around or just watch
00:29
the whole thing through that's always
00:31
appreciated and do let me know your
00:33
favorite game in the comments
00:35
and without further ado let's get to
00:37
some chess
00:39
i think what i'm gonna do is mute alerts
00:41
during the tournament just so i can try
00:43
and find full focus ten
00:46
nine and here we go
00:48
seven
00:49
six
00:50
five oh where am i i'm gonna be playing
00:52
one of these two
00:54
one thank you ross
00:57
[Music]
01:04
time
01:15
yeah this is a dubious opening but i've
01:18
had this position before
01:24
so i'm down the pawn but i have two
01:25
bishops
01:27
that's something to work with
01:32
interesting move
02:01
work
02:39
[Music]
03:14
[Music]
03:15
yeah final position was losing what to
03:17
do
03:18
not even any cell matrix ah okay
03:22
first game
03:23
that's the life
03:25
try and move on
03:26
no berserking this game
03:49
ah this line
03:50
[Music]
03:51
take
04:02
there's some weird knight seat for it at
04:03
some point
04:05
look at how it works though
04:13
so i hit the knight
04:22
i want to play a5
04:55
slightly difficult position
05:23
it's weird to adjust from two minutes to
05:25
one minute
05:27
i'm losing a piece unfortunately
05:51
it's still weird though
05:56
i think it's just losing but we'll see
05:57
if my opponent can
05:59
figure things out
06:09
some hope though
06:20
[Music]
06:30
am i winning i might be winning
06:33
winning
06:42
let's go okay somehow i won that
06:44
uh persistence pays off let's go
06:47
83rd place
06:51
ricardo have a draw looks like a draw
06:54
[Music]
06:57
i want a berserk but i don't know if
06:59
players will deserve back
07:21
so i'm pinning i was pinning the pawn
07:25
and chase away this bishop
07:30
getting h2
07:41
okay so somewhat symmetrical position
07:54
the goal is to stay up on time
08:16
that's slightly annoying might be seven
08:18
maybe
08:23
i'm still alive here
08:35
i just want to trade all the rooks
08:46
wow
08:55
um
08:55
[Music]
08:57
i have some weird move
09:03
try it
09:05
so hitting the knight this pawn is
09:06
hanging
09:11
it's probably losing for me but
09:14
worth a try
09:27
is white's knight getting trapped
09:29
there should be six coming
09:31
there's b1 i play b4 king f2 bishop b6
09:34
takes takes i think it's winning
09:36
actually
09:41
some freak accident for white this
09:43
knight's trapped
09:46
and we can't take because then i promote
09:48
the pawn
10:00
i'm basically winning on time and in the
10:02
position
10:08
let's go okay
10:10
thanks everyone for subbing
10:12
uh alerts are muted
10:14
i played vodnik the other day
10:17
yeah no berserking
10:19
vladimir actually beat me the other day
10:21
very similar line
10:29
i have this line
11:08
hmm
11:59
me
12:40
let's go okay let's go i took work
12:44
i know my heart rate was high there i
12:46
was nervous let's go
12:56
oh this line again
12:58
oh what's this line
13:03
if i just draw
13:05
i i don't remember the theory
13:07
i'll just draw and play another game
13:10
but i don't remember the theory
13:12
okay
13:12
join
13:14
let the heart rate settle down a little
13:16
bit i'm top 50
13:17
over 2700
13:21
playing we tick
13:27
okay so now this is two minute chests
13:30
oh this line
13:36
if knight d4 i'll play the exchange
13:38
stack variation
13:43
c5 the move i think c5 is a move
13:49
c8
13:51
51 is a little bit annoying
14:09
so 96 queen c8 i think was okay for me
14:15
who wants to be here
14:27
[Music]
14:37
hmm
14:45
so b3 a6
14:47
we trade i have rook c3 in the end
14:52
rook c2 coming
14:58
basics just blended upon
15:01
i have this move
15:04
knight d4
15:08
it's still interesting though
15:31
i'll play knight b3
15:43
so i triple fork everything
15:46
that's a move
16:02
there's a really interesting line
16:04
the a6 takes knight e3 kh3 work f2 a7 i
16:08
don't think i'm mating there
16:09
unfortunately
16:49
[Music]
17:30
let's go queenie two mates
17:32
let's go
17:34
i had to find my zone there
17:36
oh man
17:38
i was worse at some point probably i'm
17:40
playing rob the guy in fifth place
17:51
lost to rob three times before
17:54
i've been robbed once
18:10
mowing upon takes queen takes
18:13
might be winning a pawn here
18:25
and a
18:26
piece
18:28
oh i didn't see that move
18:31
still okay though
18:33
you have a pawn
18:40
um takes
18:46
there's 92
18:56
and b593 takes
18:59
e3 c6 is weak there
19:07
want to play d5
19:23
um
19:25
should still be okay
19:28
but i don't
19:36
know i mess this up
19:55
i want to take and play knight e5 and f4
19:58
d7
20:02
g4 here
20:16
let's move
20:53
[Music]
21:01
no
21:09
still alive
21:39
[Music]
21:42
oh i was winning too oh i tricked him
21:45
i tricked him with the premium thing
21:48
oh
21:48
[Music]
21:51
okay
21:54
so calm down calm
21:57
it's down
21:58
time almost free moved d6 i would have
22:00
been tragic
22:02
ultra staffer gambit
22:06
um yeah bishop c4 is not a great move
22:09
but
22:11
uh yeah we'll go into this
22:20
so queen f3 i'll play 95
22:25
and probably queen e2 queen h4
22:34
if i take
22:38
i think it makes sense to take
22:41
so i'm looking at um a pawn sprint
22:44
considering this but i have bishop d4
22:47
and again if takes bishop d4 and i'll
22:49
take on c4
22:55
oh i miss that oh i have this move
22:57
hey thank you you see a boat
23:01
appreciate the gifted subs
23:11
i have to defend
23:14
e5 might be coming
23:15
this move
23:17
not pretty but
23:20
it's something
23:24
i do queen b6
23:27
i don't mind trading
23:33
94 yeah king hhh point was running the
23:35
pork
23:39
letting b2
23:44
india b6
23:53
so c7 is hanging
23:54
[Music]
23:56
i can take and play b6 anyway
24:02
and see
24:06
queen c4
24:21
three now
24:25
we got five over five is tricky though
24:29
i just blundering
24:35
i'm still playable
24:37
a lot of pawns for the piece
24:40
it might be getting mated though
24:45
oh no
24:53
do you want
25:13
it's holding on for dear life here
25:23
[Music]
25:28
play this move
25:30
i just wondered
25:39
still
25:40
alive
25:42
you'll have some light
25:44
oh it's losing
25:46
yeah ah what to do ah
25:50
good position too
25:51
just blended a piece
25:53
you kenny the prime sub
25:56
okay 88th place
26:01
uh that was kind of a tilt berserk but
26:06
trying to make two here
26:32
so if takes i
26:34
i don't actually know if rock h5 works
26:36
but
26:37
looks interesting
26:38
[Music]
26:49
the united four
26:56
being the knights
27:06
i do g5
27:12
very very short position
27:20
for 25 i have knight b3
27:23
now i hit this
27:44
okay this is winning now
27:57
he takes f5 there's a funny pre-move too
28:00
i saw it coming because if i pre-move
28:01
right h7 it could be
28:03
a slight concern
28:05
okay berserk win let's go
28:08
got the london style attack
28:14
so 74th place
29:02
i was just plundering
29:05
oh to do
29:22
i should resign i'll resign
29:24
not my proudest game ever but that's
29:26
part of life
29:28
just gonna move on
29:30
oh playing cruel yarrow played him
29:32
earlier before the tournament
29:34
i'll play with stafford
29:37
if he wants one
29:42
ah this line h5
29:59
he's handling it well so far
30:03
i'm not getting
30:04
i usually hope for in the stafford
30:30
i'll do this stuff
30:39
bc5 at the right moment
30:47
look here
31:23
good move
31:32
my king should be in the center
31:52
what is this position
32:13
don't hurt me
32:19
funny line coming
32:21
oh it's not funny though
32:23
oh there's rook there
32:26
i thought it was funny
32:31
never resign when you have a rook
32:36
oh i meant to okay there was my rook
32:41
oh
32:46
i'm playing fritzy
32:58
another staffer gambit
33:00
another refutation too
33:05
ah bishop for oh i was looking at bishop
33:08
for the other day what should i conclude
33:18
i already forgot
33:25
oh white has menacing pawns again
33:43
she has a thematic break in this type of
33:45
position
33:55
okay at least getting some counter play
34:03
i miss that move
34:15
[Music]
34:34
oh no i got mated ah
34:37
that was a strong player
34:40
okay top hundred would be a decent
34:42
finish
34:44
hey i'm playing levy i'm levy what's up
34:47
lovie
34:48
long time no see
34:50

35:56
exchange he's playing well
36:06
levy knows i don't resign though
36:13
[Music]
36:24
oh i blended her rook
36:37
there's still some hope of stalemate
36:39

36:40
oh my queen
36:44
oh
36:45
good game lovey
36:47
hey it's la fong am i gonna play la fong

36:54
[Music]
36:55
playing bmw
37:02
okay 43 minutes left

around the halfway point
37:14
i just want to take and
37:17
ah this line
37:18
bishop here
37:30
she looks reasonable either for coming
37:34
never mind
37:37
f3
37:38
still want to play another four
37:41
you take first
37:44

37:54
yeah queen b6 is going to hurt me
37:58
let's take screen b6
38:00
black ones back upon
38:04
um
38:06
i'll play this move
38:09
i'll lose one of my d pawns
38:14
the g5 coming
38:19
i don't think g5 is good though
38:27
g4
38:27
[Music]
38:29
looks interesting
38:35
do i have g5
38:38
looks risky
38:40
let's do it
38:44
trying to win this pawn
39:03
just want to put the bishop on a safe
39:05
square
39:11
trade queens
39:17
[Music]
39:21
in this pawn
39:28
yeah coin can't quite play rook t1
39:30
[Music]
39:33
who's gonna dirty flag who
39:37
it should be peacefully agreed to a draw
40:03
drop
40:04
why have we not repeated
40:08
yet oh wow
40:11
okay that's a draw
40:16
i mean i can't really play for a win
40:18
there
40:19
the appointment had too much time
40:25
playing cappuccino
40:37
i just fall into some like weird opening
40:39
trap
40:44
maybe it's okay
40:49
oh
40:53
very fancy
41:05
oh no
41:06
[Music]
41:08
i just fell into some
41:11
some really bad opening trap
41:14
oh
41:15
okay i resign
41:17
i lost in 12 moves what was that opening
41:19
some weird like danish
41:22
i declined the danish but i just got
41:23
absolutely smashed there
41:26
i should try that opening someday
41:30
it's berserk ah i wanted to berserk
41:38
okay normal london play knight e5
41:52
hmm
41:54
freaking g4
42:20
yeah it's a pleasant position
42:21
[Music]
42:23
and i have three on the horizon
42:25
queensland castling
42:35
some bishops c4 eventually
42:43
to be a little bit careful
42:44
[Music]
42:51
is king b2 coming
42:54
yeah there's some danger of queen a4
43:02
this isn't so simple actually
43:05
i have a4
43:08
box probably in the sack
43:10
there's also bishop e3 which
43:13
i have this move
43:17
this looks really dangerous though
43:25
yeah bishop b3 i think i play this
43:38
this move
43:42
i was going for counter play
43:46
yeah that's a move
43:48
no king there doesn't work
43:51
does anything work here
43:56
oh this is really bad
43:57
[Music]
44:06
oh no
44:08
i still have rook g6 some hope
44:12
maybe
44:13
probably not though
44:16
take your time
44:20
take your sweet time
44:28
everyone's really taking their time here
44:35
and now i'm alive because
44:39
yeah i mean black could have cashed in
44:41
[Music]
44:44
okay now let's go full defense mode
44:48
no i took with the wrong thing i had to
44:51
take with queen
44:53
ah
44:54
my reflexes just took over there
44:57
that's the only move ah
45:00
i had the dirty flag
45:01
ready
45:05
[Music]
45:07
okay now i'll filter zurich
45:10
that was very tilting
45:13
okay opponent wants to meet me
45:16
this is how you refute scholars mate
45:26
it's a playable opening though
45:28
let's move back
45:30
back to d8 and just develop
45:44
yeah i'm trying to open some files on
45:46
the queen side
45:55
now simple idea queen
45:56
queen here there's also a cool idea
45:58
night here
46:00
i'll start with this
46:14
i'll play d5
46:25
gotta move a bit quicker here
46:41
of takes i check and mate
46:59
doing my best to attack
47:09
[Music]
48:05
you
48:27
let's go let's go
48:31
almost got dirty flag there
48:35
oh that's close
48:39
wow
48:39
[Music]
48:41
the car was still leading
48:44
oops that's not a good opening
48:47
what's this opening
48:49
why is my bishop on e3
49:01
that's why
49:48
okay that's essentially what i want
49:51
i'm trying to work up the minority
49:52
attack
50:27
let's hop upon
50:58
up a rook
50:59
let's go okay
51:01
i had to just hypnotize my opponent with
51:03
the rook moves there
51:06
okay still top 150
51:11
alabama win there
51:13
berserk again
51:18
okay accidental kings indian
51:23
i don't really play the king's indian
51:25
bro
51:28
but i'll try and uh
51:30
try and improvise
51:33
winning 1 or
51:34
28 some b5 idea
51:58
reminiscent of last game actually
52:08
positional rook ending
52:12
this pawn is regretting its life
52:14
decisions
53:03
okay let's go
53:06
trying to break back into the top
53:08
hundred
53:09
the car was still leading but it's kind
53:11
of close
53:16
playing bmw hero again
53:28
i'm grabbing the full center
53:49
wow
53:53
i fancy move
53:55
i can take and play bishop g5
53:59
that's murky though queen b2
54:06
maybe it works out
54:10
two things hanging
54:11
don't think black has any counter
54:12
attacks
54:14
okay there is that move though
54:18
oh i lost a pawn in the process what
54:21
i'm down the pawn
54:30
try and harass the bishop
54:36
i think each for
54:49
trying to create some chaos on the king
54:51
side
54:55
and now bishop h5 preventing your k8
55:07
that's a good move
55:16
go after c7
55:25
i'm in some trouble
55:31
and your rook e1 to h1
55:45
that phone's playing precisely
56:15
not much hope here
56:18
i'll resign pretty soon
56:42
any hope
56:55
okay there goes my king what to do
57:01
playing algorithm
57:23
running
57:24
this let's make it sharp
57:37
it's not a good decision
57:46
this is really unpleasant
57:54
don't even know what to do here
57:56
play a chief
58:03
ss move
58:18
that's a free bishop
58:23
i control the only open file
58:45
[Music]
58:49
you
59:12
oh
59:14
what to do
59:22
what to do i was almost surviving
59:25
opponent did blunder their their thing
59:27
at some point
59:28
well the pawns were too menacing
59:33
[Music]
59:35
okay
59:37
try and finish strong
59:42
and overcome the tilt
60:02
i love g5 there
60:20
hmm
60:33
go
60:42
the lag of focus
60:51
oh
60:54
thank you into a queen for the raid
60:56
oh good timing
60:58
okay
60:59
try and recover
61:09
okay this is a really nice opening
61:20
got my knight on d6 this knight is
61:23
pinned
61:25
f6 probably there's about f4
61:31
around this pawns attacked
61:35
this
61:36
work sense to take first
62:08
okay
62:10
looks like i'll win a game
62:13
hopefully
62:22
oops
62:23
oops no
62:26
i just blundered away two pieces in one
62:28
move
62:29
or two moves
62:35
i got way too relaxed there
62:42
i'm still gonna win probably
62:45
i don't think i deserve it but that's
62:48
sometimes how life goes
62:51
okay now i'm up a piece again
62:55
what a game
63:11
oh it's too funny
63:15
okay
63:18
oh
63:19
what was that game
63:20
[Music]
63:23
let's try and get 100 tournament points
63:26
[Music]
63:28
yeah that game felt like kangaroo chess
63:32
i messed up d4
63:38
i don't even play this opening
63:41
in queen e1 and e4 i guess
63:50
does it move
63:52
this is a move tactics
63:55
because it takes this is a
63:56
zwischenzug i guess there is a queen d2
63:59
man there but
64:02
okay
64:03
pop a pawn
64:06
after a mouse slip opening
64:14
when plunder's this
64:16
that may have been a sacrifice though
64:26
okay that's not coming
64:34
it's a little bit uncomfortable
64:38
queen f3
64:47
i should probably sock back
64:50
yeah especially because now my bishop's
64:51
happier
64:57
now there's a pin
64:58
[Music]
64:59
g4 is probably respectable
65:10
now just going for the kill
65:11
[Music]
65:16
yeah there's not really a great way to
65:17
defend rookie 7 i win the queen at least
65:19
queenie here i check and with the queen
65:22
okay
65:25
so my goal is to hit 100 training points
65:27
and finish top 100
65:30
might be difficult but
65:33
we'll see
65:34
it's going to require bizarre
66:03
i'm going after a2 kind of
66:05
opening this
66:08
play knight b4
66:12
into d3
66:21
to be a little bit careful here
66:29
be really careful actually
66:32
just offer the queen trade
66:42
it looks really good
66:45
oh my bishop
66:47
[Music]
66:49
it takes it's made in two
67:11
oops
67:13
[Music]
67:46
let's go okay
67:49
turned into a difficult game
67:52
hey top 100 let's go
67:54
83 tournament points playing doctor
67:56
funny
67:58
i don't think i'll beserk this game
68:26
um
68:37
what to do
68:44
hitting the knight threatening f5
69:05
it's interesting
69:06
[Music]
69:10
okay so this funny line
69:13
and that a4 sack the knight takes an f5
69:15
or even f5 immediately
69:18
funny line against dr funny
69:25
it's all about initiative in this
69:26
position
69:35
i think i'm probably threatening to take
69:42
take away the king's shelter
69:47
getting made in one running the bishop
69:50
let's go
69:51
that's a funny game
69:52
[Music]
69:53
okay playing deeply epic
69:57
uh
69:58
no berserking
70:05
reverse grand prix
70:30
um
70:33
i'm thinking taking taking then uh f4 in
70:36
the end
70:37
some x-ray vision along the e file
70:42
now turning f3
70:45
and now it probably makes sense for
70:46
light to take
70:50
basically going all out here
70:53
very risky but it's interesting
70:56
there's this move
71:03
i mean let's go all out
71:09
a bad feeling about this
71:14
check nine of five
71:16
hey thank you crunchy something
71:19
i read
71:26
yeah i'm down a piece here
71:29
my all-out plan kind of backfired
71:46
hoping that opponent misses e2 but
71:50
i think it's time to resign
71:55
yeah let's resign
71:56
that was unfortunate still top hundred
71:59
thirteen points away from a hundred
72:00
tournament points
72:02
berserk
72:05
midnap is working back
72:30
um
72:33
under a bit of pressure here
72:40
wow
72:42
under a ton of pressure
72:45
i just want to trade stuff
72:58
it might be working out actually
73:01
the g file
73:11
equal material but i have more access to
73:14
the g file
73:19
oh no my oh actually my bishop
73:26
oh no
73:31
yeah
73:33
if this move maybe
73:46
it's not looking good though
74:08
[Music]
74:16
and now it's looking good
74:48
let's go
74:49
got the jobs on there
74:51
when they tried to dirty trick me at the
74:53
end too
75:01
hmm
75:12
i think this is okay
75:24
um
75:25
now that's probably slightly better here
75:31
winning connect four
75:48
that's a good move too
76:03
oh no my queen
76:11
enough seven
76:14
really
76:21
i didn't see any tactics there
76:36
oh no
76:37
[Music]
76:44
oh no
76:46
oh
76:49
okay
76:50
what's my score
76:52
90 points that's gonna be tough
76:56
it's still top hundred though acaro is
76:58
probably gonna win a bitcoin
77:01
wow
77:02
i didn't see magnus though
77:04
magnus
77:21
yeah let's play ultra aggressively takes
77:23
live queen before
77:25
interesting board geometry here
77:38
takes out of this move
77:41
and it's kind of a wacky position
77:50
did someone read
77:52
oh gotham raided what's up gotham
77:56
long time no see
77:57
gg by the way
77:59
appreciate the raid
78:01
if you're just joining i'm
78:03
[Music]
78:04
having a wacky game here
78:08
trying to not lose
78:11
it's a goal in life
78:16
okay getting some fun play
78:18
take this
78:24
probably doesn't work at all it looks
78:26
kind of funny though
78:31
oh my queen
78:33
at least i got a couple things for it
78:40
[Music]
78:47
oh no
78:54
don't hurt me
78:55
don't hurt me
79:06
not hurting me
79:12
no
79:13
oh that was a funny game though
79:16
thanks for the two dollars bonnie hit
79:18
man
79:19
okay this will probably be the final
79:20
game of the tournament so no berserking
79:23
staffing out of time
79:26
let's finish with something happy
79:29
hey opponent walked into one of the most
79:31
basic stafford traps
79:35
i'll take
79:38
the bishop d4
79:46
yeah white's under a lot of pressure
79:47
here queen before coming
79:52
you can probably take the pawn
79:59
i have queen here
80:08
so i want to swing back over
80:10
oh let's just keep the bishop
80:22
i have a feeling this game won't count
80:24
for the tournament
80:26
also i have a feeling we should witness
80:29
the final
80:30
standings who's winning
80:33
icaru paused for the boss he doesn't
80:35
even need to play the final
80:38
game or whatever
80:41
gigi hikaru
80:48
okay so this game will not count for the
80:50
tournament
80:52
but it will count for pride and glory
80:57
what to do
80:59
here's this move
81:04
i'm just keep pushing the pawn
81:06
[Music]
81:10
so if takes i take with f pawn open that
81:12
file
81:14
the bishop still defends the pawn
81:16
through x-ray vision
81:19
queen g5
81:23
i think i want to play f6
81:26
if takes i take take and then take
81:29
if takes takes takes i lose a pawn
81:32
okay so this is looking good
81:40
i mean this is a funny move
81:43
so if takes i have this move
81:51
okay
81:54
uh trying to finish happily
81:58
opponent's still fighting though
82:00
let me take the pawn
82:08
here's c5
82:10
nah
82:11
look at this
82:13
double my time
82:15
where'd all my time go
82:16
[Music]
82:18
oh if rook here i have this move
82:28
i want to play b5
82:56
okay
82:58
making some progress
83:17
i was white still alive here white's
83:20
like a cockroach
83:26
okay
83:29
oh
83:30

83:33

83:37
